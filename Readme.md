= WebApp

This is just more experimenting creating a webapp entirely with JavaScript. On
the frontend, I will be using Backbone and RequireJS to build a single page app.
On the backend, I will be using Express to build a REST API that the frontend
will interact with. All the views and templating will be done in the frontend.

This will also be completely tested using either Jasmine or Mocha. Haven't
settled on either one yet.

To start this is just a clone of the TodoMVC app. I will then add a test suite
to it, to test everything from TodoMVC. Then I will add a backend that will
store the Todos in some kind of DB.

After that I will morph it into some kind of usefule (hopefully!) webapp that
does something other than just storing Todos.
